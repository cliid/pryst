# The indentation levels of consecutive lines are used to generate INDENT and DEDENT tokens, using a stack, as follows.
#
# Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the stack;
# this will never be popped off again. The numbers pushed on the stack will always be
# strictly increasing from bottom to top. At the beginning of each logical line, the lineâ€™s
# indentation level is compared to the top of the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens.
#
# If it is larger, it is pushed on the stack, and one INDENT token is generated.
#
# If it is smaller, it must be one of the numbers occurring on the stack;  all numbers on the stack
# that are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT token is generated.
#
# At the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each number remaining on the stack
# that is larger than zero.
#
# The idea is the following:
#
# Whenever you match a line break in your lexer, optionally match one or more spaces.
# If there are spaces after the line break, compare the length of these spaces with the current indent-size.
# If it's more than the current indent size, emit an Indent token, if it's less than the current indent-size,
# emit a Dedent token and if it's the same, don't do anything.
#
# You'll also want to emit a number of Dedent tokens at the end of the file
# to let every Indent have a matching Dedent token.
